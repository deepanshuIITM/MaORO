Many Objective Robust Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithm

The limitation of NSGA-II in generating well-distributed and diverse set solutions for many-
objective optimization, the robust optimization concept must be extended with evolutionary 
many-objective optimization (EMaO) algorithms to investigate the efficacy in more than 
three-objective problems. This work is an extension of test problems for robust many-objective 
optimization tasks and demonstration of the performance of updated NSGA-III procedure to two- to eight-
objective test and real-world problems.
