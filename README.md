**Four different cases of obtaining robust front**

## Many Objective Robust Optimization using Evolutionary Algorithm

## Preliminary Requirements:

[1] _pymoo_ toolbox by Julian Blank [1].

[2] NSGA-III concept has been used from [2].

[3] The definition of robustness is given in [3].

The limitation of NSGA-II in generating well-distributed and diverse set solutions for many-
objective optimization, the robust optimization concept must be extended with evolutionary 
many-objective optimization (EMaO) algorithms to investigate the efficacy in more than 
three-objective problems. This work is an extension of test problems for robust many-objective 
optimization tasks and demonstration of the performance of updated NSGA-III procedure to two- to eight-
objective test and real-world problems.
